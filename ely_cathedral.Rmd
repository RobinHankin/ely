## A remarkable geographical coincidence

Once upon a time I was collaborating with Ted Harding via email. I
was sitting at home, in Cambridge, and signed off with a short
greeting.  Next morning I received this:

```

Hi Robin,
You mentioned "a dark and damp Caldecote". This has suggested
to me the possibility of one of those curious coincidences.

To clinch it, can you send me the Lat & Long of your home?
Preferably in whatever coordinate system Google Maps uses:
to find out what they are, locate your home in Google Maps,
move your mouse pointer over it, and (keeping it still) then
right click.

You will get a little drop-down menu at the bottom of which
is "What's here?". Left-click on that, and the coordinates
(degrees North and East as decimal fractions) will appear in
the "Search Maps" box at the top.

Once I have your coordinates (all 6 decimal places please) I will
then compute the degree of agreement with my coincidental surmise!
```

I could not resist this; my reply:

```

Hello Ted

a wonderful mystery!  My front door is, according to Google Maps,
at 52.206275,-0.025892

replicable?  Another try gives  52.206272,-0.025893

Perhaps you need the back door, where I was
sitting when I emailed you:  52.206367,-0.025846 and
a replicate of  52.206373,-0.02585
```


Ted's Reply:

Hi Robin!
The conjecture (prompted by visualising our respective geographies
when you talked about "dark and damp Caldecote") was that a line
drawn from Caldecote through Ely Cathedral and continued might pass
fairly close to my house. A sample point in Caldecote confirmed this.
I then wondered how close it would be if I had the precise coords of
your house. Result: Very close indeed -- about 100 yards (though we
are about 30 miles distant from each other: You to Ely Cath about
20 miles; me to Ely Cath about 10 miles).

To be precise now, the Google coords (in R-talk) are
## Robin Hankin (front door)
RH  <- c(52.206275,-0.025892)  # deg N & E (front door)
EC  <- c(52.398657, 0.263873)  # Centre of Ely Cath octagon
LO  <- c(52.476138, 0.381944)  # Chimneypot on my house at Little Ouse
P   <- rbind(RH,EC,LO)         # Positions
P.E <- P[,2] ; P.N<-P[,1]      # East & North

# deg North at LO of the line from RH to EC:

P.N[1] + ((P.E[3]-P.E[1])/(P.E[2]-P.E[1]))*(P.N[2]-P.N[1]) # 52.47705
    ## (compare 52.476138)

# Distance North of LO:
(P.N[1] + ((P.E[3]-P.E[1])/(P.E[2]-P.E[1]))*(P.N[2]-P.N[1])) - P.N[3]
##0.000909196    degrees Lat. 1 deg Lat ~= 69 statute miles:

1760*69*0.000909196    # 110.4128 yards North of my chimney pot

## Change RH to (52.206367,-0.025846) (back door)
RH <- c(52.206367,-0.025846)
## Result: 0.000884149 deg South of LO
1760*69*0.000884149  # 107.3711  -- 3 yards closer

So my conjectured coincidence was pretty close! I'm not going to
put a P-value on it, though -- there's an element of selection
bias in there. Thanks for going along with the game!
```

Well I thought about it and decided to use spherical trigonometry to
investigate.  I sent a brief analysis to Ted, in which I reported that
the spherical analysis revealed an even more impressive coincidence.
Ted's reply [my words preceded with a ">"]:

```

Well, it was much more "psychological" than that! In fact your
"dark and damp Caldecote" had suggested that conditions at Caldecote
were more dire than they seemed to be around my neck of the woods,
which prompted a mental image of where we respectively were. Since
Ely is a sort of geographical "hub" for me, and I knew pretty well
where Caldecote is, I suddenly saw all three lined up. A glance at
my Road Atlas backed this up. Then the possibility of a really close
coincidence for our respective residences occurred to me, and a
sample calculation based on Google coords backed this up too.
Then I got hooked and thought I'd try to track it down as precisely
as possible. The rest is history.

A significant methodological improvement. And much closer! I wonder
if allowing for oblateness would change things much; but that's
a more sophisticated calculation and I'm putting it aside ...
```

# Analysis

First, we show a diagram taken from Google earth, illustrating the
three locations:

 
```{r fig.cap="Ted's observation"}
knitr::include_graphics("googlemap.png")
```

Above we see the three points, together with lines joining them,
forming almost a perfect straight line.  Now the latitude and
longitude of three positions: my house (`RH`), Ely Cathedral (`EC`)
and Ted's house (`LO`, Little Ouse):

```{r latandlong}
RH  <- c(phi=52.206275, lambda= -0.025892)  # deg N & E (front door)
RH  <- c(phi=52.206367, lambda=  -0.025846)
EC  <- c(phi=52.398657, lambda=  0.263873)  # Centre of Ely Cath octagon
LO  <- c(phi=52.476138, lambda=  0.381944)  # Chimneypot on my house at Little Ouse
```

We can plot these, *in orthographic projection*, using R:

```{r,echo=FALSE}
LL <- rbind(RH,EC,LO)
latx  <- LL[c(1,2,3,1),1]
longx <- LL[c(1,2,3,1),2]

aspect <- 1/cos(LO[1]*pi/180)
plot(longx,latx,asp=aspect,type='b',xlab="longitude",ylab="latitude",main="Little Ouse (LO) , Ely Cathedral (EC), and Caldecote (RH)",sub="orthographic projection")
for(i in 1:3){text(LL[i,2],LL[i,1],rownames(LL)[i],pos=4)}
```

Above we see the three points, together with lines joining them,
forming a very narrow triangle.  Visually, the points are on a
straight line; we can zoom in on Ely Cathedral:


```{r,echo=FALSE}
RADIUS_OF_EARTH <- 6378137
plot(
	(longx-longx[2])*pi/180*RADIUS_OF_EARTH,
        (latx - latx[2])*pi/180*RADIUS_OF_EARTH*aspect,
	asp=1,type='b',xlab="distance East (meters)",ylab="distance North (meters)",
	xlim=c(-50,50),ylim=c(-50,50))
text(0,0,"EC",pos=4)
```

Above we see that the line from RH to LO passes within 100m or so of EC.

# Spherical geometry

As Ted observes, spherical geometry represents a significant
improvement.  Below I reproduce the spherical analysis (in a modified
and more maintainable form), and at the end I follow up Ted's
suggestion of allowing for oblateness.  First we use the Haversine
function to calculate great circle distances, `gcd()`:

```{r definegcd}
gcd <- function(pos1,pos2){  # great circle distance
  dphi <- pos1[1]-pos2[1]
  phis <- pos1[1]
  phif <- pos2[1]
  dlam <- pos1[2]-pos2[2]
  2*asin(sqrt((sin(dphi/2))^2 + cos(phis)*cos(phif)*(sin(dlam/2))^2))
}
```

Above we are using the explicit Haversine formula

$$ 2r\arcsin\left(\sqrt{\sin^2\left(\frac{\varphi_2 -
\varphi_1}{2}\right) + \cos \varphi_1 \cdot \cos \varphi_2 \cdot
\sin^2\left(\frac{\lambda_2 - \lambda_1}{2}\right)}\right).$$

With the observed values, the two terms under the square root in the
Haversine formula are both ${\sim}10^{-6}$.

Convert to radians:

```{r}
RH <- RH*pi/180  # Convert to radians
EC <- EC*pi/180
LO <- LO*pi/180
```

Distances between the three places, in radians:

```{r}
EC_LO <- gcd(EC,LO)
LO_RH <- gcd(LO,RH)
RH_EC <- gcd(RH,EC)
```

Giving

```{r}
gc_dist <- c(EC_LO,LO_RH,RH_EC)
names(gc_dist) <- c("EC_LO","LO_RH","RH_EC")
gc_dist
```

Above we see the three sides of the triangle expressed in radians; in
meters we have:

```{r}
gc_dist * RADIUS_OF_EARTH
```

Compare with the `geosphere` package (generally, variables calculated
with the `geosphere` package end with `g` or `_g`).

```{r}
RHg <- rev(RH)*180/pi
LOg <- rev(LO)*180/pi
ECg <- rev(EC)*180/pi
library("geosphere")
gc_distg <- c(
EC_LOg = distCosine(ECg,LOg),
LO_RHg = distCosine(LOg,RHg),
RH_ECg = distCosine(RHg,ECg))
rbind(gc_dist*RADIUS_OF_EARTH,gc_distg,gc_dist*RADIUS_OF_EARTH-gc_distg)
```

Above we see two things: firstly, that Ted lives about 10km from EC
and I live about 30km from EC; and secondly, that the calculations are
in approximate agreement, differing by $2\times 10^{-7}\,{\mathrm m}$,
or about $0.2\,\mu{\mathrm m}$.  Now calculate the sines and cosines:

```{r}
sin_a <- sin(EC_LO)
sin_b <- sin(LO_RH)
sin_c <- sin(RH_EC)

cos_a <- cos(EC_LO)
cos_b <- cos(LO_RH)
cos_c <- cos(RH_EC)
```

Finally, use the Haversine formula to calculated the angles of the triangle:

```{r}
angle1 <- acos((cos_c-cos_a*cos_b)/(sin_a*sin_b))
angle2 <- acos((cos_a-cos_b*cos_c)/(sin_b*sin_c))
angle3 <- acos((cos_b-cos_c*cos_a)/(sin_c*sin_a))

angles <- c(angle1,angle2,angle3)
names(angles) <-  c("EC_LO_RH","LO_RH_EC","RH_EC_LO")
angles
```

Observe how small two of the angles are, the second of which was Ted's
original observation.  Verify with `geosphere::bearing()`, for the
moment using spherical trigonometry; calculate `angles_g` with
geosphere and compare:

```{r echo=FALSE}
angles_g <-
c(
bearing(LOg,ECg, f=0)-bearing(LOg,RHg, f=0),
bearing(RHg,LOg, f=0)-bearing(RHg,ECg, f=0),
360-(bearing(ECg,LOg, f=0)-bearing(ECg,RHg, f=0))
) * pi/180
```

```{r}
rbind(angles,angles_g,angles-angles_g)
```

We see that the approach used here agrees closely with that of
`geosphere`.  We can interpret the smallness of the angles in two
ways.  Firstly:

```{r}
dist <- c(
gcd(LO,RH)*c(angle1,angle2),
gcd(LO,EC)*c(angle1)
) * RADIUS_OF_EARTH
dist
```

Above, the first two elements of `dist` show the distance from RH-EC
(produced) to LO, and LO-EC (produced) to RH, in *meters*.  The third
shows the distance from RH-LO to EC.  See how small these values are!
We can verify against `dist_g`, the same distances calculated with
 the `geosphere` package:

```{r echo=FALSE}
dist_g <- c(
dist2gc(ECg,LOg,RHg),
dist2gc(RHg,ECg,LOg),
dist2gc(LOg,RHg,ECg))
```

```{r}
rbind(d=dist,d_g=dist_g,`d-d_g`=dist-dist_g)
```

Above, we see agreement to within about 0.4mm.  Secondly, we can
interpret by calculating the excess angle:

```{r}
(E <- sum(angles) - pi)
(area <- E*RADIUS_OF_EARTH^2)
```

Something is very wrong here as the excess angle is negative.  This
is, I think, due to rounding error.  Running the same formulae through
mathematica [file `ely.mma`] gives:

```
In[127]:= N[angle1+angle2+angle3-Pi]                                                                                                                                                                           

                     -9
Out[127]= -5.66402 10
```

showing that Mathematica's default numerical precision gives pretty
much the same result.  However, we can force Mathematica to use more
digits in its evaluation:

```
In[128]:= N[angle1+angle2+angle3-Pi,digits=20]                                                                                                                                                                 

                                  -9
Out[128]= 5.5405140041818607405 10
```

which give a positive answer (which turns out to be reasonably
robust).  I do not know why the results are so similar in magnitude.
However, we can use this value to calculate the area of the triangle:


```{r}
(area <- 5.540514e-9*RADIUS_OF_EARTH^2)
```

Perhaps the area in square kilometers is more interesting:

```{r}
area/1e6  
```

Using the approximation of plane triangle in which area is half base
times height, we might ask how close line RH-LO passes EC:

```{r}
2*area/(gcd(LO,RH)*RADIUS_OF_EARTH)
```

that is, about eleven meters.


# Ellipsoidal earth




Now, introduce an ellipsoidal earth.  We will use WGS-84, and assume
that the latitude given by Google Maps is geodetic latitude.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
  f <- 1/298.257223563    # WGS-84


lambert_distance <- function(p1,p2){


  s <- gcd(p1,p2)
  ## *reduced* latitude:
  b1 <- atan((1-f)*tan(p1[1]))
  b2 <- atan((1-f)*tan(p2[1]))

  P <- (b1+b2)/2
  Q <- (b1-b2)/2
  X <- (s-sin(s))* (sin(P)*cos(Q)/cos(s/2))^2
  Y <- (s+sin(s))* (cos(P)*sin(Q)/sin(s/2))^2

  return(s-f*(X+Y)/2)
}

vincenty <- function(p1,p2){ # p1 and p2 are point 1 and point 2, (geodetic) latitude and longitude

  a <- 6378137.0 # equatorial radius from WGS-84   (meters)
  f <- 1/298.257223563 #  WGS-84

  b <- (1-f)*a  # polar radius from WGS-84

  phi1 <- p1[1]  # latitude of p1
  L1 <- p1[2]    # longitude of p1

  phi2 <- p2[1]  # latitude of p2
  L2 <- p2[2]    # longitude of p2

  U1 <- atan((1-f)*tan(phi1))
  U2 <- atan((1-f)*tan(phi2))

  L <- L2-L1
  lambda <- L2-L1  

  for(i in 1:10){
    sinsig <- sqrt(
    (cos(U2)*sin(lambda))^2 + (cos(U1)*sin(U2)-sin(U1)*cos(U2)*cos(lambda))^2)
    cossig <- sin(U1)*sin(U2) + cos(U1)*cos(U2)*cos(lambda)
    sigma <- atan2(sinsig,cossig)

    alpha <- asin(cos(U1)*cos(U2)*sin(lambda)/sin(sigma))
    sigma_m <- acos(cos(sigma) - 2*sin(U1)*sin(U2)/cos(alpha)^2 )/2

    C <- (f/16)*cos(alpha)^2*(4+f*(4-3*cos(alpha)^2))

    lambda <- L - (1-C)*f*sin(alpha) * (sigma + C*sin(sigma)*(cos(2*sigma_m) + C*cos(sigma)*(-1+2*cos(2*sigma_m)^2)))
  #  dput(lambda)

  }
  
  u <- abs(  cos(alpha) * sqrt((a^2-b^2)/b^2)   )
  A <- 1 + u^2/16834*(4096 + u^2*(-768 + u^2*(320-175*u^2)))
  B <- u^2/1024*(256 + u^2*(-128+u^2*(74 - 47*u^2)))
  delta_sigma <- B*sin(sigma)*(cos(2*sigma_m) + B/4*(cos(sigma)*(-1+2*cos(2*sigma_m)^2) - (B/6) *cos(2*sigma_m)*(-3+4*sin(sigma)^2)*(-3+4*cos(2*sigma_m)^2)))
  s <- b*A*(sigma - delta_sigma)

  alpha1 <- atan2(cos(U2)*sin(lambda), +cos(U1)*sin(U2)-sin(U1)*cos(U2)*cos(lambda))
  alpha2 <- atan2(cos(U1)*sin(lambda), -sin(U1)*cos(U2)+cos(U1)*sin(U2)*cos(lambda))
  return(c(alpha1,alpha2,s))
}
```


```{r}
lamb <- c(
 lambert_distance(EC,LO),
 lambert_distance(LO,RH),
 lambert_distance(RH,EC))
names(lamb) <- c("EC_LO","LO_RH","RH_EC")
lamb
```

Above, `lamb` refers to the Lambert distance function, defined on the
ellipsoidal earth.  The distances are very similar to those
calculated on the great circle:

```{r}
gc_dist
lamb - gc_dist
(lamb - gc_dist)/gc_dist
(lamb - gc_dist) * RADIUS_OF_EARTH
```

So the ellipsoidal distances are less than the spherical distances by
about 10-30 meters (although most of this is because the local radius
differs from the average radius of the earth at this point).  We can
go on to use function `vincenty()` to solve the inverse problem.  The
inverse problem is this: given two points, calculate the path between
them of minimal length.  We are interested in the initial and final
azimuth of the path.  We can also compare with `angles_g`, created
with `geodesic_inverse() from the `geosphere` package.

```{r,echo=FALSE}
angles_g <- 
c(
  geodesic_inverse(LOg,ECg)[1,2]-geodesic_inverse(LOg,RHg)[1,2], 
  geodesic_inverse(RHg,LOg)[1,2]-geodesic_inverse(RHg,ECg)[1,2], 
  360-(geodesic_inverse(ECg,LOg)[1,2]-geodesic_inverse(ECg,RHg)[1,2])
  )*pi/180
```


```{r}

vincenty(RH,LO)[1]
vincenty(RH,EC)[1]
angles_gcd <- angles
angles_lamb <- c(
  vincenty(LO,EC)[1]-vincenty(LO,RH)[1],
  vincenty(RH,LO)[1]-vincenty(RH,EC)[1],
  2*pi-(vincenty(EC,LO)[1]-vincenty(EC,RH)[1]))
names(angles_lamb) <- c("EC_LO_RH","LO_RH_EC","RH_EC_LO")
angles_lamb
(jj <- rbind(angles_lamb,angles_gcd,angles_g))
jj <- rbind(jj,sd=apply(jj,2,sd))
jj
```

We see that the angles under an ellipsoidal earth are slightly bigger
than under the spherical earth, but all three are in close agreement.


# Statistical analysis

It would be nice to use the methods of inferential statistics to
furnish some insight into this collinear coincidence.  However, I have
not succeeded to date.  There does not seem to be a clear null
hypothesis to test [and if there were, what would rejection of it
mean?]; there is no credible alternative hypothesis; no family of
distributions to consider; no statistical ensemble; and no likelihood
approach seems to be appropriate.

And as Ted says, there is certainly an element of selection bias in
there.  Presumably we could condition on the fact that our houses were
roughly aligned alongside Ely Cathedral.  But how rough is rough?

Although the calculations consider EC, LO, and RH on equal footing, we
prefer to consider, with Ted, that EC is the origin.  This is arguably
preferable to working in an affine space.  Further, Ted---perfectly
reasonably---considers _both_ EC and LO to be fixed: my house being
notionally movable or randomly positioned, in some sense.

One criterion often used for coincidences is to consider possible
occurrences that are as surprising as the observation.  Typical
examples would be coin-tossing, in which HHHHHH is held to be just as
surprising as TTTTTT.  In the LO-EC-RH case, what observations might
count as equally surprising as the one Ted saw?  In reality we see
LO-EC-RH but surely LO-RH-EC [that is, RH in between LO and EC] or
RH-LO-EC [LO between RH and EC] would be just as surprising.  Or
perhaps if the EC-RH distance was exactly the same as the EC-LO
distance.  Or perhaps EC-RH being perpendicular to EC-LO.  Or even RH
being due North (or South, or East, or West?) of EC.  But none of
these are as striking as collinearity of LO-EC-RH.

Going the other way, what _more_ impressive coincidences might we
consider?  The only sensible one is the double coincidence of both
collinearity of LO-RC-RH _and_ equality of the LO-EC and EC-RH
distances (arguably, simultaneous equidistance and perpendicularity
might technically count, but this is lame at best).

But it is not clear to what extent the selection bias should be
incorporated in any null, or evaluation of any coincidence.  It is not
clear whether we want to analyse the coincidence purely
post-selection, or if our analysis should include an element of the
selection process.  Besides, the selection process itself is poorly
defined but whatever it is, surely it is at least part of the
coincidence under investigation.

However, it does not seem unreasonable to ask how close an alignment
we could reasonably expect, on the basis of some process which
includes an element of randomness.  We might also wish to quantify the
unlikeliness of the observed close alignment.  To do this, we fix EC
and LO, and consider a randomly chosen point P.  Observe that this
approach contains zero selection bias: we are not considering any
selection that Ted might have carried out.  A reasonable value for a
$p$-value would be to calculate the probability that a randomly chosen
point `P` on the earth has angle `EC-P-LO` smaller than `EC-RH-LO`
(which would result in `RH-P` passing closer to `LO` than `RH-EC`
does):

```{r}
